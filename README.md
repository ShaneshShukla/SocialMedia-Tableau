# SocialMedia-Tableau
This Tableau dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of user engagement on social platforms, offering valuable insights into how different factors influence the time spent by users. By leveraging data on user behavior across dimensions such as location, interests, income, age, and gender, the dashboard enables stakeholders to gain a deeper understanding of audience preferences and behavior patterns.

Through interactive visualizations, users can explore how time spent on social platforms varies across different segments, allowing for targeted strategies and personalized content recommendations. For instance, they can examine whether users in specific locations or with particular interests tend to spend more time on social media, or how engagement levels differ based on demographic factors such as age and gender.
